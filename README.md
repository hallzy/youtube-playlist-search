# Youtube Playlist Search

This started as a copy of the "Playlist Search For YouTube" extension, but I am
cleaning it up and customizing it to my liking.

## Customizations

- Searching is now more 'fuzzy', so it searches words individually instead of
  together.
- Removed list.js and jQuery dependencies (jQuery was literally being used for
  list.js and one other thing, and list.js honestly just complicated the script
  more because it just wasn't necessary).
- Cleaned up the code significantly

## TODO

* Cleanup CSS and fix the styling
* Add The channel name that the video comes from
